            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2012 by the Mudau family, All Star Gas Station began as a small, family-run business with a big vision: to create a welcoming space where customers could refuel—both their vehicles and their spirits. Over the years, we’ve grown from a single pump station into a full-service convenience hub, all while staying true to our roots in community and customer care.</p>
